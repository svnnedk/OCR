# Simple OCR project - Object Character Recognition

Includes two scripts one for recognizing one line of text and the other for recognizing a whole image.

The scripts are made with easyOCR

This is how the result looks like if you use the 2.png file in the image folder:

| The image before OCR  | Whole image | One sentece |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
